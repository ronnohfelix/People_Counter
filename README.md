# People_Counter
An OpenCV project.
Using OpenCV and YOLO model, this project is able to detect and count people. Yolo weights (nano version) has be provided but you can use large version. Yolo is a trained model. Yolo is popular object detection model. Using GPU instead of CPU to run the code is encouraged to improve the speed. Good luck.
